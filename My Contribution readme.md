# My Contribution

I followed Baraa’s data warehouse project as a guided build.  
What I did myself:
- Loaded the sample ERP + CRM CSVs into SQL Server
- Ran the Bronze → Silver → Gold layers
- Wrote my own SQL query to get total sales by product category
- Exported the results as CSV

I’m using this project to show I understand data warehouse basics, ETL pipelines, star schema, and SQL reporting.

This is a portfolio practice project only.
